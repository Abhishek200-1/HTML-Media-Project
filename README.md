# HTML-Media-Project
This project demonstrates the use of HTML media elements and modern tags to create a more engaging and structured website. Weâ€™ve incorporated images, audio, video, and embedded external content with iframes, alongside semantic elements like &lt;header>, &lt;footer>, &lt;main>, and &lt;aside> for clean organization.
